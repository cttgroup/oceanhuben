## The purpose of the project

The mission of our project is to develop a set of technologies for search, identification and analysis of fish accumulations in ocean fishing areas. It is well-known that such kind of information is very important for commercial fishery as good as for marine environmental protection and marine biology research. Prospected methods will include, for instance, results of remote sensing imagery processing.
Contemporary practice of large marine fauna communities monitoring includes mainly direct measurement methods from oceanographic ships and distantly from aircrafts. With appearance of satellites, we could also monitor oceans globally and get measurements of oceanographic parameters including sea surface temperatures, chlorophyll concentration etc. for wide areas.
Today we can also get satellite images of earth surface with high resolution better than one meter enabling detect and identify separate objects. Such kind of data is not widely used in ocean surface monitoring now. During our research we will investigate capabilities of usage high-resolution satellite imagery for fish communities detection.

## The key ideas of the project

Fishing vessels spend a lot of time during their search for fish aggregations. Long-lasting search is costly, and new methods for fast fishery prospecting could help. Today fishermen use sonars for fish aggregation search, but sonars have short range. Also fishermen use fishery forecasts which are made by specialists on the basis of long-term observation of fish aggregations dynamics and its connections with oceanographic characteristics.
A lot of fish species – so called “pelagic” – are habitants of near-surface sea layer. Pelagic fish aggregations in most cases can be detected by direct observations. Due to this fact, some time ago aerial fish prospecting became quite popular. During flight, observers could detect and identify large fish aggregations. Unfortunately, aerial search flights are costly and non-effective in commercial usage if a fishing fleet is not big as several dozens of vessels. Today’s development of aerial prospecting is connected mostly with unmanned aircrafts (UAV’s).
We analyzed previous experience and current research, so we found that there where fixed detections of fish aggregations during observations from space (say from ISS). Preliminary estimations demonstrate that existing scanners characteristics of remote-sensing satellites like Worldview, Geoeye, Peliades, SPOT series is enough for detection and identification of such object like fish aggregation.
During this project we are going to develop algorithms and software for remote sensing data obtaining, processing and analyze to get finally information about fish aggregation presence, characteristics and coordinates.

## Tasks

We detected some important tasks to be solved:

1)	Localization of sea regions for observation. 
Fishing areas have large squares of tens and hundreds of square kilometers while one high-resolution satellite image covers no more than several square kilometers. That means that we can’t get satellite imagery coverage for such a giant area. There have to exist key parameters for limitation of observed area.

2)	Satellite imagery localization
We need such an imagery that contains definitely our object of interest (fish aggregation). Localization for such a point would consider satellite trajectory, aggregation dynamics, weather conditions and so on.

3)	Fish aggregation identification. Even an experienced observer may be confused identifying some similar object like algae, garbage, cloud shadow etc.as a fish aggregation. Today’s progress in automatic image processing technologies may help us to develop a reliable method of automatic object identification. 


## Limitations and difficulties

There exist some limitations for prospective technology applications we have to keep in mind:
-	Some fishing areas  -mainly in north seas – are often covered by clouds, so they are unavailable for satellite imagery in visible optic range.
-	In-operation satellites with high-resolution scanners are used mainly for land cover observations. In case of need to scan some marine areas it may be unavailable because of duty or its trajectory may be far from ocean areas.

## Prospects of development and application

Despite of mentioned limitations, we are convinced that the development of these technologies will be a new level of development of fisheries intelligence and, in general, monitoring systems of ocean biological communities. 
In addition, specialists look optimistically at UAV application outlook. We expecting to use our results also in the area of UAV. We also count that it may ve very effective to combine results of satellite and UAV sea area observations within a framework of some complex system.
